"""
Question 8
We know K means clustering produced a higher distortion
when we calculated the distortion. But we can see this
in the picture as well when we compare the two graphs.
In K means clustering on the west coat one of the clusters
is stretched very thin, this as apposed to the
hierarchical_clustering graph.

This is all caused by the fact that k-means clustering is
based on high population and only includes the southern cities
and does not include the northern californian cities and washinton

Question 9
The heierarchical clustering requires less human supervision
